# Web-based Polygon Draw and Edit


## How to run
Open ‘index.html’ file to run the app


## Description
There are two main modes for our program, ‘View-mode’ and ‘Edit-mode’. Only in ‘Edit-
mode’ the user may edit the polygons.

Every polygon that is created is automatically in ‘Edit Mode’ and is therefore drawn inside
dashed rectangle for awareness of users.

In order to choose other polygon to edit, just right-click on it. To exit Edit-mode, right-click
on the background of the canvas.

‘Clear polygons’ deletes all polygons, while ‘Clear screen’ deletes all polygons and resets
canvas’ image.

### Main Features:
1. Creating polygons with ‘Add Polygon’ button and assigning its nodes’ coordinate  with double-click on the canvas
2. Loading Image to the canvas from the computer
3. Deleting polygon’s selected nodes (if all nodes are selected, polygon is deleted)
4. Dragging existing node to reshape an existing polygon
5. Moving the whole polygon when it’s selected by dragging it
6. Zooming in on canvas
7. Changing polygon’s edges color
8. Changing polygon’s edges width
9. Creating an output JSON file containing all polygons data
